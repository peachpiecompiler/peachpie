## What is PeachPie?

PeachPie is a modern PHP compiler based on the Microsoft Roslyn compiler platform. It allows PHP to be compiled and executed under the .NET runtime, thereby opening the door for PHP developers into the world of .NET – and vice versa.

## Project goals

- **Both-way interoperability**: the project allows for hybrid applications, where parts are written in C# and others in PHP. The parts will be entirely compatible and can communicate seamlessly, all within the .NET framework.  

- **Full .NET compatibility**: compiled programs run on the reimplemented PeachPie runtime, fully compatibly with the PHP runtime.

- **Security**: since programs run within the standardized and manageable .NET or .NET Core environment, the code is fully verifiable without any unsafe constructs. In addition, PHP applications can be distributed source-lessly for added security benefits. 

- **Cross-platform development**: the project compiles legacy PHP code into portable class libraries, enabling developers to build cross-platform apps and libraries for Microsoft platforms.  

- **Increased performance**: PeachPie's extensive type analysis and the influence of Microsoft Roslyn should provide an improved performance of PHP applications and components. 

## How to use PeachPie

There are currently two ways of using PeachPie via `dotnet`: in your favorite shell or comfortably in Visual Studio using our official extension. 

### IDEs

You can comfortably work with PeachPie in your favorite IDEs. Download our official [Visual Studio extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iolevel.peachpie-vs), which makes working with PeachPie compiler as convenient as possible. The extension allows you to easily create a new project using our templates, build & debug, profile your PHP code using the VS diagnostic tools and deploy your project to Azure:

alt="Peachpie Extension" border="10" /></a> 
</p>

You can also use VS Code or Rider to build and debug PeachPie projects. 

### Command line building

Alternatively, you can also work with PeachPie on the command line. Please refer to our [short introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVWVInYiYLY) to see how to run the compiler on the command line and to the [Getting Started](https://docs.peachpie.io/get-started/) section in our documentation.
